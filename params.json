The build directory is used as working space while your application is being packaged. It is safe to delete the build directory after your setup script has finished running. The files in the dist directory are the ones needed to run your application.\r\n\r\ndist directory is your main directory where your exe will be built and named by your script name i.e here ( keylog.py --> keylog.exe)\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEP 4: MAKING dist DIRECTORY TO YOUR FINAL APPILACTION BY WINRAR APPLICATION.\r\n\r\nTHIS STEP INCLUDE SOME BASIC STEP IN WINRAR APPLIACTION .
